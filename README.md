Game for the record.

The countdown begins and the user starts driving, driving the car using the steering wheel and gas/brake pedals.

The user has a health bar that decreases every time the user encounters obstacles on the road. There are several of them:
1. a police car (appears once per minute of the game and tries to reach the user, if they catch up - the game ends);
2. blocks (the game ends);
3. puddles with oil (slows the user down for 10 seconds);
4. cracks in the road (slow down and take away HP).

You can also collect various boosters on the way: nitro, protective shield, magnet for coins, hearts for XP.
One coin on the road is equivalent to 10 coins in the bank.
One heart gives 25 health.
Magnet, shield, nitro are given for 15 seconds.

Do not use Zenject.
There must be a build for an Android device.
